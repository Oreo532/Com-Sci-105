Why is Spider-Man 2 so dang good? I love the movie because of how personal it is to just people.
I love seeing the realistic struggles of Peter and how being Spider-Man is actually hindering the life of 
Peter Parker himself. It's crazy to see how much being a superhero would suck in real life if 
you weren't someone who was already rich and famous, because Peter has to struggle on both the financial 
and personal side of his life because of how he chooses to be Spider-Man. I could talk for so much longer
but I think I'll stop here.
