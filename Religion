Something excited about college has been the fact that there's a Church on campus that I can go to whenever I want.
I like being about to go to a Church that's 10 minute walking distance from me, because it means that I don't have 
any excuses for not going since it is so close. I've been on a retreat that has been me meet some new friends and 
has already given me some of the most memorable experiences I've had in college so far. I hope to take advantage 
of more opportunities of the Church and become closer in my relationship with God.
