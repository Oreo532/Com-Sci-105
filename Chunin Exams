Alright so I've been watching early Naruto and I gotta say, pretty good. I finsihed the Land of Waves Arc and I
really just like the flow of this show. Characters are pretty cool, I like how Naruto is just so different
from other Shonen protagonists because he kinda sucks and is consistantly outclassed by his rival Sasuke, which 
makes it seem like he's the real protagonist. It's not because Naruto is lazy, but because Sasuke is just better
than him right now and Naruto acknowledges this. Anyways, I just started Chunin Exams and they just took a test 
that had me more on the edge of my seat than anything in the last Arc. It's already so good and I haven't even gotten to 
the hype stuff yet!
