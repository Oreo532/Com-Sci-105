This is just a space for me to rant about the COVID and how it has affected me. I've had a cousin and an uncle
that have passed away from the COVID and it has been very hard on me and my family. It's also made me feel very
unmotivated for this next step in my life (college) because this whole online class isn't for me. 
Hopefully this can all go away soon, and things can go back to how they used to be before.
